"""
klt/core.py -- xp-agnostic (numpy or cupy) Karhunen-Loeve Transform for
RFI removal and adaptive noise estimation, ported from
03a_clean_filterbank.py.

Two distinct outputs, on purpose (see conversation history / paper
methods section): RFI removal and noise estimation are separate
mechanisms built on the same eigendecomposition, not one thing. Keeping
them as two return values (rather than folding noise estimation
silently into the cleaning step) is what makes the ablation in
validation/run_ablation.py meaningful -- the SNR improvement from each
can be measured independently.

1. RFI removal (matches original semantics exactly):
       R = cov(signals - mean(signals))
       eigenspectrum, eigenvectors = eigh(R), sorted descending
       neig = number of eigenvectors needed to reach `threshold` of
              cumulative variance
       rfi_template = reconstruction using only the top `neig`
                      eigenvectors (the original code's `recsignals`)
       cleaned = signals - abs(rfi_template)
   The abs() in the subtraction is preserved exactly as in the original
   `output_matrix = (matrix - np.abs(rfitemplate_full.T))` -- this is a
   deliberate choice in the original code (avoids adding energy back in
   where the low-rank reconstruction locally overshoots negative), not a
   default introduced here.

2. Noise variance estimation (new, distinct from RFI removal):
       noise_var = mean of the *discarded* eigenvalues (those below the
                   variance threshold), normalized by the number of
                   channels in the window.
   This is what GulpPipeline.preprocess() in the hyperseti fork can use
   as a per-subband noise estimate, instead of normalize()'s single
   scalar std for the whole gulp. It is computed from the discarded
   eigenvalues specifically because those represent the variance NOT
   explained by the dominant (RFI) modes -- i.e. an estimate of the
   noise floor after the dominant correlated structure is accounted for.
